    <p><i>My name is <bold>Esther Adetimehin</bold> and I love Technology. Technology stimulates my imagination. 
        Technology is also fun, because you learn more, and can experience more on 
        computers, because computer is Technology. You can apply for jobs, and schools 
        using technology. There is all type of technology. That’s all the world be on.
         A phone, computer, tablet, watches, cameras, JPs, Xbox, headphones, heaters, 
         robots, TV, these are all technology Devices. We use and watch these things 
         24/7 which means 7 days a week, and 24hrs each day. 
         My First time being introduced to technology was in the SS1. 
         My mother bought me a laptop so I could do my school work. 
         I got on my laptop every day after school. I not only did that, but I 
         also played games on my computer. It was fun playing on the laptop. 
         I enjoyed it, but it was really for work, but you know I had a little 
         free time. I’m just in love with technology now.</i> </p>

                There are a number of benefits of CSS, including:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Faster Page Speed</li>
    <p>More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one
         CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML 
         document.</p>

         <li>Better User Experience</li>
         <p>CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting.
             When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience 
             improves.</p>

             <li>Quicker Development Time</li>
             <p>With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. 
                One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. 
                , for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, 
                look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of 
                that same type.</p>

                <li>Easy Formatting Changes</li>
                <p>If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to 
                    fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and 
                    you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.</p>

                    <li>Compatibility Across Devices</li>
                    <p>Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all
                         devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with 
                         HTML to make responsive design possible.</i></p>

                            <h1>Third Section</h1>
                            <p>Padding is the inner space between the content and the border of 
                                your box while Border is the perimeter of the box. 
                                Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick 
                                colored line like the green one pictured above whereby 
                                Margin is the outer space (or lack of space) 
                                surrounding the box.
